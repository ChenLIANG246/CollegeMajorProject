 data analysis of college majors
 
The high quality of education in the United States attracts students from all over the world. Is it better to choose a less popular major based on your interests? Or choose a major that is easier to find a high-paid job? I'm sure many students have had similar confusions before.

Last year，when I worked for a Chinese newspaper as a journalist in Silicon Valley. I covered a story about a software development major student who had been unemployed for one year after graduated from San Jose state university.

(Here is the link to my article, unfortuanatly, it is in Chinese: https://www.worldjournal.com/6675662/article-%E8%BB%9F%E4%BB%B6%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E7%95%A2%E6%A5%AD%E7%94%9F-%E5%98%86%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E9%9B%A3%E6%89%BE/)

I was suprised that the so-called "good major" is not really that easy for every one to get a high-paid job.This article also attracted widespread public concern. Our readers were interested in the topic of how to choose a college major. What majors are likely to get higher salaries?What majors are easier to find a job? Does study for a STEM major mean a higher salary？Will a graduate degree increase our salary?

I decided to use the data analysis knowledge I had learned to find out the internal connection between major choice and employment situation.

There are five .csv files for me to do the research. All data is from American Community Survey.
