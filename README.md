Data Analysis of College Majors
 
The high quality of education in the United States attracts students from all over the world. Is it better to choose a less popular major based on your interests? Or choose a major that is easier to find a high-paid job? I'm sure many students have had similar confusions before.

In 2019，when I worked for a newspaper as a journalist in Silicon Valley. I covered a story about a software development major student who had been unemployed for one year after graduated from San Jose state university.

I was surprised that the so-called "good major" is not really that easy for everyone to get a job. This article also attracted widespread public concern. Our readers were interested in the topic of how to choose a college major. What majors are likely to get higher salaries? What majors are easier to find a job? Does study for a STEM major mean a higher salary？Will a graduate degree increase our salary?

I decided to use the data analysis knowledge I had learned to find out the internal connection between major choice and employment situation.

The data is from the American Community Survey.
